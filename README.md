# Sundry. Toggleable Tweaks for mainly Pf2e

> [!NOTE]  
> This module is intended to be a grab bag of useful features which are all intended to be **toggleable** and off by default. IE you can choose which ones you like to turn on! Maybe one day i'll add a sort of gui setup process or something but that's a later me problem :)

> [!WARNING]  
> While v12 is technically supported, support for some features may fail as this module is developed primarily for FVTT v13

    - Note: this feature requires the GM to be active to work
